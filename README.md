Port the music spreadsheet to its own page - add a button to see the optional additional notes (like a review or something), add a button to get a link to that album which will be like masonlane.dev/music?album="OK Computer" or maybe the "OK Computer" part would be the ID of the album, and the ID would go simply in order starting at 1 for the first album I reviewed
Make the nav bar that links every page to every other page
